## The challenge

Users should be able to:

## Objectives

- My challenge is building the project without routing. To address this, I'm using Pinia Store to connect all app components across three stores
  - FormStore: Used for managing all steps of the form.
  - PlanStore: Manages user plans.
  - PersonalInfoStore: Stores user information (used during the login step).
- Ensure this design is responsive across all devices, while also enhancing its aesthetics and user-friendliness with smooth transitions.
- Incorporate validation using regular expressions to guide users by providing hints for correct input and indicating errors.

## Technologies

- Vue js
- Pinia Store
- Tailwind CSS

## What I learned

- Unlock advanced style and animation possibilities by linking `v-bind` with style and JavaScript within the HTML template.

- Enable server-side rendering (SSR) using `defineAsyncComponent` _(currently commented out)_, allowing for advanced context management to store and load component paths along with their content.

- Enable easy editing by utilizing context to add information, which is then easily reflected on the website, making the process simple and straightforward.
